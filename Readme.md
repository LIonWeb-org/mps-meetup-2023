# LIonWeb MPS Meetup 2023 Demo

This project contains a demo of LIonWeb for the MPS Meetup 2023 event.

In the `properties-parser` directory we have a parser and code generator for a variant of the properties file format.

In the `mps` directory we have an MPS project which can import the properties language and its instances.
