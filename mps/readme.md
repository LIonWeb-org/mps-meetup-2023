# MPS Project for MPS Meetup 2023 LIonWeb Demo

Uses MPS version 2021.1.4

Needs _Path Variable_ `lionweb.mpsmeetup2023.home`, pointing to the root of this git repo.

Depends on [lioncore-mps](https://github.com/LIonWeb-org/lioncore-mps)
Please copy the build results from `${lioncore-mps.home}/build/artifacts/io.lionweb.mps/` into 
`${lionweb.mpsmeetup2023.home}/mps/lioncore-mps`, so that there's a directory `${lionweb.mpsmeetup2023.home}/mps/lioncore-mps/io.lionweb.mps/languages`.
